TEDx events are licensed conferences of the same style, but organized by an independent group and directed to its local community.

Our team stands out for the diversity of personalities and ideas, in favour of collective and personal growth. We intend to break down barriers, stereotypes, and prejudices, and embrace difference as a strength – an open door to a better version of ourselves! – rather than reacting with fear, phobia or snobbery. Through bold and disruptive ideas, we wish to be the beginning of a chain(ge) (re)action which will culminate with a deep change of mentalities, overlapping a greater receptiveness to difference. Ultimately, our mission is still to spread ideas—and what kind of ideas would we spread in a homogeneous world?</p></body>",
